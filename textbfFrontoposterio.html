<b>Fronto-posterior
fiber tract disconnection common to post-stroke ideomotor apraxia and
aphasia.</b> A classical observation in behavioral neurology is the common
occurrence of apraxia and aphasia. We investigated the common anatomical
basis for these two brain disorders in a VLSM study of 108 chronic
stroke patients [26]. Results suggested that the disconnection of
the AF/SLF complex underlies both ideomotor apraxia and aphasia (Figure
8). This finding is consistent with a network perspective of high-level
functions, as ideomotor apraxia can be characterized as a failure to
translate action representations into movements, and severe aphasia as a
failure to transform language representations into speech.</div>
