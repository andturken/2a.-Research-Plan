<b>Processing
speed and long association tracts.</b> In another study, we examined the
role of white matter lesions in processing speed (WAIS-III Digit-Symbol
Test) deficits in left hemisphere chronic stroke patients [28]. A
VBM analysis of DTI fractional anisotropy (FA) measures from 39 control
subjects implicated bilateral parietal and temporal regions, as well as
the left middle frontal gyrus in better processing speed. A VLSM
analysis of lesion data from 72 stroke patients confirmed posterior
parietal involvement, and further implicated the external capsule in
impaired processing speed (Figure 6). Processing speed is a key
neuropsychological domain, and these results suggest white matter
disconnection can predict chronic stage processing speed performance. In
this project, we will correlate tractography-based whole-brain
structural connectivity measures from a large group of post-acute and
chronic stroke patients with NIH Toolbox processing speed index.</div>
