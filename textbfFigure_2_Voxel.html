<b>White-matter involvement in high-level cognitive abilities:
Voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) analysis of Western Aphasia
Battery measures in chronic post-stroke aphasia.</b> We used WAB scores and
digital lesion reconstructions from 191 chronic (&gt; 1 year
post) left hemisphere stroke patients to identify brain regions
associated with persisting aphasic impairments [59]. At each voxel
in MNI space, WAB performance measures were compared between patients
who do and do not have a lesion at that voxel with <i>t</i> -tests. To
correct for multiple comparisons (p &lt; 0.05), non-parametric
permutation testing was used (5000 permutations) to determine the
significance threshold. The resulting maps were compared with
probabilistic maps of major white matter fiber tracts. We found deep
white matter involvement for all four major WAB components, highlighting
the importance of white matter disconnection in chronic aphasic
impairments (Figure 3).</div>
