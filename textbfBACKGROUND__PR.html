<div><b>BACKGROUND / PROBLEM STATEMENT</b></div><div>


</div><div>employ advanced MRI structural and functional network connectivity measurements in order to account for the variability in functional and cognitive stroke outcome. The guiding hypothesis for this project is that structural disconnection and functional connectivity alterations following stroke can help explain the loss and sparing of high level abilities better than the characterization of lesion location and extent alone. Our long-term goal is to capitalize on emerging concepts and techniques from modern systems neuroscience to better understand the consequences of neurological damage and ultimately to contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of Veteran patients who have survived brain injury.</div><div>

According to the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) estimates, over 15,000 Veterans are hospitalized for stroke each year (VA HSR&amp;D Stroke QUERI, 2015). Around 40% of stroke survivors are left with moderate to severe functional disability [1, 2]. Stroke outcome prediction is critical for patient management decisions and for planning rehabilitation efforts. However, long-term stroke outcome is highly variable [3]. Characterization of stroke neuropathology with brain imaging techniques has contributed to a better understanding of why some patients recover and why some patients are left with persisting disability [4].</div><div>


</div><div>the effects of stroke on sensory and motor systems are better understood than the neural correlates of high-level cognitive impairments following stroke. The bulk of clinical studies have focused on post-stroke sensori-motor dysfunction. However, it is high-level cognition abilities that allow a patient to cope with the demands of every life and maintain functional independence. High-level cognitive abilities depend on distributed activity across large-scale brain networks. Therefore, whole-brain connectivity mapping techniques can improve our understanding of overall functional outcome and cognitive abilities in stroke. Traditionally, efforts to characterize brain-behavior relationships in stroke have focused on lesion location and extent. However, it is not possible at present to reliably predict long-term functional and cognitive stroke outcome using brain imaging data. There has been a growing emphasis on looking beyond the lesion and assessing how stroke affects the structural connections that interlink brain networks and the physiological interactions among distributed brain regions that support high-level cognitive abilities [5-13]. The majority of these studies have involved acute stroke patients. Scientific and clinical understanding of network-level effects of stroke beyond the acute stage remains incomplete. In general, advanced whole-brain structural and functional connectivity mapping techniques, such as those developed by the NIH Human Connectome Project, have not yet been adopted for clinical research on stroke. The proposed project aims to address these gaps in current knowledge.</div><div>

<b>Localizationist versus network-level characterization of lesion-deficit relationships.</b> Behavioral neurology has traditionally emphasized the localization of specific neurological deficits to individual brain structures. For instance, Brocaâ€™s aphasia has traditionally been related to left posterior inferior frontal gyrus damage, amnesia has been related to hippocampal lesions and visuo-spatial neglect to right parietal lobe injury. The localizationist approach assumes a one-to-one relationship between neural structure and function. High-resolution brain imaging and voxel-based MRI analysis techniques have pushed the ability to identify the neural correlates of neurobehavioral deficits to millimetric precision [14]. Deficits in basic sensory and motor processes can be localized with considerable certainty. However, emerging evidence from modern cognitive neuroscience research indicates that the traditional localizationist approach cannot fully explain how complex cognitive abilities are instantiated in distributed brain networks, or how damage to brain network connections affects high-level cognition [6, 8, 15-22]. Correlating brain connectivity alterations with neurological impairments requires a different conceptual approach than is commonly employed in standard voxel-based MRI assessments.</div><div>


</div><div>Standard brain imaging analyses seek to locate brain regions that are commonly injured in patients presenting with a specific symptom, or to identify locations where regional tissue properties correlate with symptom severity. The three left hemisphere stroke patients shown in Figure 1 all have language production deficits. There is no overlap in their lesion locations. However, they share in common white matter connectivity loss along the arcuate fasciculus, which allows language output to be transferred from posterior temporal regions to anterior regions that support language output. White matter tractography allows the connections that support high-level abilities to be delineated in the healthy and injured brain [23]. Analysis of white matter changes along specific tracts has allowed the discovery of relationships between individual structural connections and deficits in specific neuropsychological domains [24-28]. Recently developed neuroimaging techniques allows the analysis of brain-behavior relationships at an even higher level - at the level of distributed brain networks that support high-level cognitive abilities [29].</div><div></div>
