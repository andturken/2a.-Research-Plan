<b>Combined
structural and functional connectivity assessment of chronic stroke.</b> We
have come across several patients that do not fit the traditionally
accepted lesion-deficit patterns. For instance, the patient shown in
Figure 14 (right) suffered a lesion that damaged left lateral posterior
temporal cortex, corresponding to classical Wernicke’s area. However,
more than a decade post-stroke, the patient does not present with
Wernicke’s aphasia, but only with anomia (WAB aphasia quotient = 92 out
of 100). Tractography analysis indicates sparing of dorsal and ventral
fronto-posterior white matter connections circumventing the lesioned
area. Consistently, resting-state fMRI functional connectivity analysis
indicates a left lateral frontal, posterior parietal and bilateral
inferior temporal network, possibly underlying the patient’s successful
recovery.</div>
