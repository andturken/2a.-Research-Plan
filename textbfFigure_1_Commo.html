<b>Network-level disruption due to focal brain injury.</b> Owing to the complexity of white matter connectional anatomy, any white matter region can contain fiber pathways linking several different brain regions, and any white matter tract can contain fibers associated with multiple brain networks [30]. Local damage to a white matter region or the disconnection of a white matter tract can have distal effects on the function of remote brain regions interconnected by the damaged structural connections [16]. Recent research has shown that white matter damage affecting multiple pathways can explain why individual stroke patients often present with impairments across multiple neuropsychological domains [7]. Similarly, gray matter lesions affecting highly-connected association areas can disrupt the functioning of large-scale distributed neural networks [12, 17, 31]. Thus, network-level analysis holds great promise studying stroke-related neurological change and stroke outcome.</div><div>

<b>Structural network analysis with HARDI diffusion MRI.</b> Newly developed whole-brain tractography techniques allow the mapping and quantitative analysis of the structural connectivity patterns of multiple brain networks (“structural connectome”) in the same patient [20, 23]. One such technique, high-angular-relation diffusion imaging (HARDI), traces water diffusion profiles from a large number of gradient directions. Unlike diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which has been the method of choice for white matter imaging in previous stroke studies, HARDI does not assume that each voxel in a diffusion MRI image reflects the contribution of a single fiber system. By modeling complete voxel-wise diffusion profiles, HARDI can resolve multiple fiber trajectories that intersect within an imaging voxel [32, 33]. This allows white matter fiber pathways to be traced through crossing-fiber regions and towards their cortical terminations [34]. Only few studies so far have employed advanced tractography-based network analysis techniques to assess stroke-related impairments of high-level cognitive abilities [11], and to our knowledge no major stroke study has made use of the HARDI technique.</div><div>


</div><div>In this project, we propose to assess network-level structural connectivity changes in stroke with the HARDI tractography technique, and to correlate post-stroke structural connectivity loss with long-term functional and neurocognitive outcome measures. For this purpose, we will employ newly developed multi-band accelerated multi-shell HARDI protocols released by the Human Connectome Project (HCP) [35, 36]. These protocols will allow us to acquire high-quality and high spatial resolution diffusion MRI datasets in clinically feasible acquisition times. To our knowledge, this will be the first application of the advanced HCP protocols in stroke research.</div><div>

<i class="">Graph theoretic</i><i> analysis of functional network organization.</i> Cognitive dysfunction following white matter damage or cortical association areas ultimately arises from the disconnection of brain regions that normally work in concert through network connections [20, 27, 28, 37]. The resting-state fMRI functional connectivity analysis technique derives spatial maps of functionally-specialized brain networks from the temporal correlations in spontaneous BOLD signals measurements across the whole brain [38]. Graph theoretic analysis techniques [15, 39] can be used to estimate the information processing capacity and characterize the functional organization of resting-state networks from BOLD signal correlation patterns. Resting fMRI functional connectivity and graph theoretic network analysis techniques have been previously used to reveal disrupted functional network organization in stroke [6, 8, 31]. In this project, we will employ high-temporal-resolution resting-state MRI acquisitions based on the Human Connectome Project multi-brain accelerated EPI protocols [40]. The high-temporal-resolution HCP protocols, which have not been used yet in stroke research, will improve artifact reduction – a common problem in patient resting fMRI studies [41] – and also improve the ability to detect subtle functional connectivity changes [40]. We will derive graph processing metrics of information processing capacity and functional network organization from resting fMRI connectivity patterns the characteristic path length (CPL) [42], communicability and modularity [15]), and correlate these graph theoretic network-level metrics with functional and cognitive stroke outcome measures.</div><div>

<b>Predictive statistical modeling: Multi-variate analysis of brain-behavior relationships with the Partial Least Squares regression technique.</b> Lesion deficits relationships in stroke have typically studied with voxel (VLSM, VBM) and region-of-interest (ROI) based mass univariate statistical analyses. We will employ the Partial Least Squares (PLS) multi-variate analysis technique [43-45] whole-brain connectivity change patterns in stroke with neurocognitive outcome profiles. The predictive value of the observed brain-behavior relationships will be assessed with cross-validation. PLS regression has been successfully employed in previous stroke studies [43, 46-48], but not in conjunction with advanced MRI structural and functional connectivity measurements, as proposed in the present project.</div><div>

<b>“Virtual disconnection analysis” based on clinically available structural brain images.</b> Advanced MRI protocols to map brain connectivity are often not available or not feasible in clinical settings. Several recent studies have used lesion reconstructions from clinical patient scans in order to intersect binary lesion maps with brain white matter and functional connectivity atlases from healthy subjects and to predict neurobehavioral outcomes based on the estimated disconnection [7, 18, 46, 48-50]. In principle, such an approach has potential clinical applications for diagnostic neuroimaging of stroke. However, the validity of estimating disconnection from clinically available anatomical brain scans has yet been assessed by direct comparison with structural and functional connectivity measures from the same patients. In this project, we will collect advanced MRI data from a large group of middle-aged and elderly Veterans without stroke history. Using automated lesion identification techniques [50, 51], we will derive binary lesion masks from stroke patient T1- and T2-weighted anatomical images. We will use patient lesion reconstructions to simulate lesion-induced disconnection based on the structural and functional network connectivity measures from the demographically-matched controls. We will assess how well HARDI tractography and resting-state fMRI-based measures of network-level changes can be estimated from the combination of patient lesion information and a demographically-relevant brain connectivity imaging database. The validation of the virtual disconnection analysis approach will be a novel contribution to the brain injury research, potentially facilitating clinical translation. The MATLAB-based software and the normative connectivity database we will develop for this purpose will be made available to other VA clinicians and researchers through the VINCI system, who will be able to apply them to their own datasets.</div>
