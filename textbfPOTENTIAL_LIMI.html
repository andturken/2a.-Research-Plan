<div><b>POTENTIAL LIMITATIONS / ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES</b></div>


<div>
<b>Cross-sectional design.</b> Lack of longitudinal data will limit
our ability to establish cause effect relationships.</div>


<div>We believe an important first step is to demonstrate the utility of
advanced connectome mapping in stroke neuroimaging. If we successfully
demonstrate correlations between clinically-relevant outcome measures
and brain connectivity measures in this project, this will pave the way
for a subsequent longitudinal study to characterize how cerebral
connections change during the acute-to-chronic transition, and for an
interventional study, for instance with targeted brain stimulation, to
modulate brain networks to ameliorate deficits.</div>


<div>
<b>Ensuring consistent data quality / QA protocol.</b> Neurobehavioral
assessments will be reviewed regularly for coding and scoring errors.
MRI data will be archived using XNAT (Extensible Neuroimaging Archive
Toolkit), including documentation of post-processing steps and automated
quality assurance reports for any MRI artifacts.</div>


<div>
<b>Statistical power.</b> Unlike studies designed to pin down the
precise neural correlates of specific abilities, we are aiming to
correlate neurological change patterns (e.g., how disconnected have the
cerebral hemispheres have become) with broad functional and cognitive
outcomes. PLS regression is well-suited for this kind of problem, where
the objective is to isolate one or two latent factors (weighted sums of
brain measures) that best predict functional and cognitive outcome. The
general rule for PLS is to have ~20 observations per
factor [44, 45], which will be attained with 50-60 patients in this
study, allowing for up to 15% attrition or missing data points.</div>


<div>
<b>PROJECT TIMELINE.</b> Subject recruitment and testing will start
immediately. Stroke patient recruitment and data collection will be
completed by the end of Year 3 (1-2 new patients per month), with a
matching number of control datasets (n = 60) allowing final data
analyses for Aims 1 and 2 throughout Year 4. By Year 4, data collection
for all control subjects (60 total) will be completed, so that the
normative brain imaging database for middle-aged and elderly Veteran
controls will be ready by the end of the project. Software and database
development will continue until the second quarter of Year 4, at which
time these will be ready to share on VINCI. The findings will be
disseminated to the widest possible audience in the research and
clinical communities, at local and national conferences, and in
peer-reviewed scientific and clinical journals.</div>
