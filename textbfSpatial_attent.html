<b>Spatial attention deficits and fronto-parietal white matter connections.</b> Dr. Krista Parker examined spatial neglect deficits with the Standard Comprehensive Assessment of Neglect (SCAN). VLSM implicated white matter lesions in spatial attention deficits in both hemispheres [61]. This finding is consistent with reports that spatial neglect is associated with disconnection of the dorsal fiber pathway connecting frontal and posterior areas involved in attention [52].</div><div></div><div>fhgfg&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>kjhkj</b></div>
