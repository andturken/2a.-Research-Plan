<div>The preliminary studies presented above relate post-stroke white matter
damage along cerebral association pathways in persisting deficits in
multiple neuropsychological domains. Another general observation from
these studies is that when used in conjunction with healthy brain
connectivity maps, even manual lesion reconstructions can be used to
predict post-stroke network disconnection and associated chronic-stage
neurobehavioral deficits. One of our goals in the proposed project is to
improve the analysis of post-stroke disconnection using clinically
available brain imaging information.</div>

<b>Optimizing spatial normalization of stroke patient scans for
white matter mapping.</b> Automated atlas-based analysis of stroke
neuropathology requires precise registration between individual patient
scans and reference templates. However, used templates have typically
been developed from young and middle-aged subject data. The presence of
large lesions, ventricular dilation and sulcal widening due to global
atrophy can introduce residual anatomical distortions when standard
image analysis protocols developed for healthy subjects are used to
process stroke patients, in particular for deep white matter regions
[62]. We have optimized the unified segmentation / normalization
protocol in the SPM software package to improve the co-registration of
ventricles and to make use of the shape of intra-cranial space to
estimate pre-morbid brain shape and size (Figure 10).</div>
