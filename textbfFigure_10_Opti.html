<div><b>Figure 10. Optimized spatial normalization of white matter
anatomy in stroke patients. </b></div>


<div>In this project, we propose to obtain structural and diffusion MRI data
from a large group of demographically-matched Veterans without stroke
history in order to develop a reference template and normative white
matter connectivity dataset. This way, we propose to optimize the
analysis of individual stroke patient brain scans.</div>
