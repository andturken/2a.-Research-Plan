<div><b>SIGNIFICANCE AND INNOVATION</b></div><div>


</div><div>To our knowledge, the use of state-of-the-art multi-band EPI protocols
for multi-shell HARDI diffusion MRI and for high temporal resolution
resting fMRI will be new for stroke research. This will enable the use
of advanced brain connectivity mapping techniques, which until recently
required prohibitively long acquisition times for imaging patients, in
clinically-feasible acquisition times. Network-level characterization of
the neural correlates of stroke-related impairments has only recently
started, with emphasis on acute stroke and early stages of recovery
[6, 9, 11, 52]. Published studies that we are aware of typically use
rely on only one imaging modality. An important contribution of this
project will be the combined use of structural and functional
connectivity assessments from the same group of patients. Another
contribution will be the characterization of whole-brain connectivity
changes in chronic stroke, the analysis of brain connectivity measures
in relation to clinically-relevant measures of persisting posts-stroke
impairment in high-level abilities. Several previous investigations have
compared binary lesion reconstructions of stroke lesions with white
matter atlases derived from young and middle-aged adults to estimate
white matter disconnection and relate it to behavioral impairments in
stroke [7, 18, 49, 53, 54]. In this project, we will acquire data
from a demographically-relevant control group to characterize normal
white matter anatomy. In most research and clinical settings, only
lesion information derived from structural imaging is available. We will
assess how well white matter disconnection estimated from structural
image-derive lesion maps agrees with disconnection assessed with HARDI
tractography. We believe this comparison will be another contribution of
this project to stroke research and the clinical literature.</div><div></div><div></div><div>dgfdhgfhjgf</div>
