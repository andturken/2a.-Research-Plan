<b>Connectional
anatomy of brain regions implicated in persisting auditory comprehension
impairments in chronic post-stroke aphasia.</b> We demonstrated the first
combined use of lesion data, DTI tractography and resting-state fMRI
connectivity analyses to characterize the networks that support language
comprehension [57]. Our group had previously identified four brain
regions as critical for different aspects of auditory comprehension in
chronic post-stroke aphasia: the left posterior middle temporal gyrus
(MTG), anterior superior temporal gyrus (ant STG), a part of BA39, and
the orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus (BA47) [58]. We
assessed the connectional anatomy of these four regions using
tractography and resting-state fMRI connectivity analysis in healthy
controls. Thus, by comparing lesion locations associated with persisting
deficits in chronic aphasia with connectional anatomy of the healthy
brain, we showed that these critical language areas are part of a richly
interconnected network, supported by five major pathways (Figure 2). The
MTG showed the most extensive connectivity pattern. Prior research had
shown that lesions to this region, and not to posterior STG, the
traditional Wernickeâ€™s area, result in the most severe auditory
comprehension deficits in chronic post-stroke aphasia. According to our
analysis, a likely explanation is that posterior MTG lesions cause
wide-spread disconnection of the language network, possibly precluding
chances for recovery through network reorganization.</div>
