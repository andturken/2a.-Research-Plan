<b>Automated
white matter analysis in stroke.</b> We implemented a fully automated
protocol for delineating major white matter pathways and for quantifying
their properties, such as tract volume and mean fiber density. Once
optimal spatial normalization parameters for the T1w anatomical scan are
computed, the same transformation can be applied to the whole-brain
tractograms. Provided that the co-registration to reference MNI template
is accurate, major tracts can be isolated guided by digital white matter
atlases, without manual intervention (Figure 12, above). We extended
this approach to derive cortico-cortical connectivity matrices
(“connectomes”), which can be analyzed with graph theoretic measures
[39] to determine network-level disconnection and the information
processing capacity of spared fiber systems (Figure 13, below). In this
project, we propose to apply these protocols to develop a
demographically-relevant normative brain imaging database, and to
analyze brain connectivity measures from stroke patients in relation to
their functional and cognitive outcomes.</div>
