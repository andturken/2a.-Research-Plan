<b>Predictive statistical modeling.</b> We employed the Partial Least
Squares (PLS) regression technique to predict Western Aphasia Battery
performance measures from estimated regional gray matter loss and
structural disconnection measures. For each patient, total gray and
white matter lesion volumes, amount of gray matter loss in each of the
55 left hemisphere anatomical parcels in the Harvard-Oxford atlas, and
the degree of structural disconnection of each atlas parcel were entered
into the PLS model as predictor variables. All 10 WAB subscores were
entered as outcome variables. PLS regression with ten-fold
cross-validation identified one injury pattern consisting primarily of
structural disconnection measures that accounted for 50% of the
variance in overall WAB performance (equally weighting all subscores).
Another injury pattern involving gray matter loss in posterior temporal
cortical regions accounted for an additional 4% variance in WAB
comprehension subscores. Thus, multi-variate predictive modeling with
PLS supported the notion that loss of structural connectivity in the
left hemisphere is a strong predictor of chronic speech and language
impairments in aphasic stroke.</div>


<div>In the proposed project, we aim to extend the multi-variate predictive
modeling approach to assess how well the degree and extent of structural
disconnection can account for variation in functional outcome and
multiple cognitive domains in chronic stroke.</div>
