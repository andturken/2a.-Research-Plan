<b>Executive
dysfunction and the left superior longitudinal fasciculus.</b> Executive
function is <b>critical for coping for everyday challenges, and
thus for stroke functional outcome. We analyzed</b> Wisconsin Card Sorting
task performance [WCST, 60] in 51 left-hemisphere chronic stroke
patients using VLSM and tract lesion load analysis, and found that
revealed that both left frontal and posterior (temporo-parietal) lesions
affect set shifting performance, as well as white matter lesions along
the superior longitudinal fasciculus (Figure 7). These findings
implicated fronto-temporo-parietal disconnection in executive
dysfunction.</div>
