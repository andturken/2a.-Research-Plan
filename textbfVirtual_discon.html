<b>Virtual disconnection analysis of chronic aphasic impairments.</b> Our investigation of chronic post-stroke aphasia led us to hypothesize that a major determinant of long-term outcome might be the loss of inter-regional connectivity, rather than the loss of a single critical cortical center or the disconnection of a specific fiber pathway. To address this question, we first produced inter-regional structural connectivity matrices using HARDI diffusion MRI data from 42 middle-aged and elderly healthy subjects. Specifically, we computed whole-brain tractograms for each subject with probabilistic streamline tractography. We then spatially normalized the tractograms to MNI space and isolated the fiber streamlines associated with pairs of 110 cortical and subcortical gray matter regions-of-interest according to the Harvard-Oxford atlas. We intersected the spatially normalized binary lesion reconstructions from each of our 191 stroke patients with the spatially normalized fiber tract trajectories from the 42 healthy subjects, and estimated the degree and extent of structural disconnection that is likely to be produced by each lesion (Figure 5).</div>
