<div><b>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND THE INTERPRETATION OF FINDINGS</b></div>


<div>
<b>Aim 1. Structural disconnection and stroke outcome. 1)</b> First,
<b>Network-based Statistics (NBS)</b> [80, 81] will be applied to
normalized structural connectivity matrices from stroke patients
identify which inter-regional connections are correlated with functional
outcome (NIHSS, FIM), cognitive performance (NIH-TB fluid cognition
score). This analysis will be analogous to voxel-wise fMRI, VBM or VLSM
analyses of brain-behavior correlations, except that network connection
weights, rather than voxel intensity, will be used as the dependent
variable. Similar to the SPM framework for voxel-wise VBM analysis, NBS
addresses the correction for multiple comparisons problem in connectome
analyses with large numbers of inter-regional network connections
tested. Demographic variables, education, time post-stroke, age at
stroke onset, rehabilitation history (duration in months) and pre-morbid
ability will be used as co-variates. Statistical significance of the
regression coefficients for individual connections will be assessed with
one-sided <i>t</i> -tests (p &lt; 0.05, correction for multiple
comparisons with non-parametric permutation testing). The <i>t</i> -test
for negative correlations between connection weight and neurobehavioral
outcome will identify the inter-regional disconnections that are
associated with poorer outcomes. We predict that more extensive loss of
inter-regional structural connectivity will indicate more severe
impairments in global outcome measures, as a severely disconnected brain
has much less resources available for coordinating activity across
distributed cerebral networks. We also predict that connections between
lateral prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal cortex and postero-lateral
temporal cortex will best correlate with overall functional and
cognitive outcome, as fronto-posterior networks support the high level
cognitive abilities required for coping with challenging situations in
the daily environment [85].</div>

<b>2) Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression</b> will be used in a
second set of analyses [44, 45]. PLS is commonly employed for
predictive modeling when there are more variables (in this case, brain
measures) than observations (patients). While the NBS analysis outlined
above is designed to reveal the specific inter-regional disconnections
that are associated with poorer outcomes, the PLS analysis will be
designed to assess how well neurobehavioral outcome measures can be
predicted from weighted linear combinations of regional tissue integrity
and inter-regional connectivity measures. PLS has been employed in
previous stroke studies to predict behavioral outcomes from lesion
patterns with behavioral outcomes [43, 46-48]. PLS will first be
applied using as predictors regional gray matter measures from each
atlas-defined ROI parcel. As before, demographic variables, education,
time post-stroke, age at stroke onset and rehabilitation history
(duration in months) will be added as co-variates. The output of PLS
analysis will be a set of weights for predictor variables that best
account for variability in the neurobehavioral outcome measure, the
percentage of variance explained by the resulting model, and a measure
of the predictive accuracy of the model based on ten-fold
cross-validation. The PLS analysis will be repeated by including the
inter-regional connection strengths from the structural connectome
analysis in addition to regional gray matter measures. Three models will
be compared with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), which adjusts
for differences in model complexity: regional gray matter measurements
alone, structural connectivity measures alone, and regional and
connectivity measures combined in the same model. Improvement in
explained variance and predictive accuracy with the addition of
structural connectivity measures in the PLS model will indicate that
structural disconnection accounts for unique variance in stroke
functional and cognitive outcome that is not captured by lesion location
and extent alone. In our Preliminary Studies section, we have described
how we used the PLS technique to account for the variability in one
high-level cognitive ability.</div>

<b>Aim 2. Functional connectivity alterations and stroke outcome.
1)</b> Graph theoretic measures of network information processing capacity
will be computed for the whole brain, as well as for two major
resting-state networks, the fronto-parietal executive network (FPEN),
the default mode network (DMN), defined according to the Yeo-2011
functional connectivity atlas. Lesion masks will be used to exclude
abnormal tissue from the analysis of BOLD signal correlations.
Characteristic path length, communicability and modularity measures will
be computed from the inter-regional functional connectivity matrices.
Graph theoretic measures of functional network organization will be
correlated with functional (NIHSS, FIM) and cognitive (NIH-TB fluid
cognition) outcome measures. Linear regression will be employed,
including as co-variates demographic information, education, time
post-stroke, age at stroke onset, rehabilitation history (duration in
months), pre-morbid ability (Barona Index) and lesion volume. We predict
that better functional organization of the whole-brain and the
fronto-parietal executive network (implicated in domain general
high-level cognitive abilities) will be associated with higher scores on
functional and cognitive stroke outcome measures (NIHSS, FIM, NIH-TB).
<b>2)</b> As in Aim 1, we will employ PLS regression in a second set
of analyses. Three models will be compared. the first including only
regional (atlas ROI-wise) tissue loss, capturing lesion location and
extent; the second model including both regional tissue loss and
structural disconnection; and the third including regional tissue loss,
structural disconnection and graph theoretic measures of function
network organization. While structural connectivity determines the
potential for neurocognitive recovery through network reorganization,
functional connectivity measures show how well this potential has been
realized. Thus, the two measures of cerebral connectivity, structural
and functional, provide related by complementary information. Therefore,
we predict that model comparison based on the AIC criterion will
indicate that how well functional brain networks are organized captures
for stroke outcome variability that is not accounted for by lesion
location or structural disconnection.</div>

<b>Aim 3. Assess how well network disconnection can be predicted
from clinically available anatomical brain scans.</b> Lesion masks derived
from T1- and T2-weighted anatomical scans will be used for conducting a
“virtual lesion analysis” with the brain connectivity measures from
the demographically-matched control group. The lesion likelihood maps
produced by the Automated Lesion Identification software package [50,
51] will be binarized at 50% lesion probability. Lesion masks from
individual patients will be intersected with tractography data from all
100 controls, and structural connectivity measures will be re-computed
for each control dataset after removing the intersecting fiber
streamlines. Percent reduction in structural connectivity after
“virtual disconnection”, averaged over all control datasets, will
provide an estimate of the likelihood of inter-regional disconnection in
each individual patient based on binary lesion location alone, taking
into account normal inter-individual variability in the aging brain. For
each patient, Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) will be computed between
the “virtual lesion” disconnection estimate and the tractography-based
disconnection computed in Aim 1. Similarly, functional connectivity
matrices and graph theoretic measures of functional network organization
will be recomputed for controls after removing gray matter ROIs that
intersect with the binary lesion mask for each patient. The
brain-behavior relationship analyses outlined for Aims 1 and 2 will be
repeated with the structural and functional virtual disconnection
estimates to assess how well functional and cognitive stroke outcome
measures can be predicted from brain connectivity changes inferred from
T1w and T2w anatomical scans alone. As a growing number of stroke and
other brain injury studies are combining patient lesion reconstructions
with brain white matter and functional connectivity maps from healthy
subjects to predict neurobehavioral outcomes [7, 18, 46, 48-50], the
validation of this approach with actual structural and functional
connectivity measurements from the same patients will be a novel
contribution to the brain injury research. The MATLAB-based software and
the normative connectivity database we will develop for Aim 3 will also
be made available to other VA clinicians and researchers through the
VINCI system.</div>
