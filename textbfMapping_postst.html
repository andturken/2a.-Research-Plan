<b>Mapping
post-stroke white matter disconnection with HARDI diffusion MRI
tractography.</b> We have been conducting HARDI tractography studies,
focusing on the effects of disconnection of major white matter tracts on
cognition and language. The technique we are using, streamline
tractography with constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) [32,
33], allows for the resolution of crossing-fibers (multiple tracts
passing through the same region) and provides high resolution
reconstructions of white matter anatomy (Figure 11).</div>
