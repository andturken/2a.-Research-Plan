<div><b>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</b></div>


<div>
<b>Study setting.</b> This project will be conducted at the VA
Northern California Health Care System (VANCHCS), Martinez campus. VA
Martinez works closely with the VA Sacramento Medical Center.
Importantly for patient recruitment, VANCHCS serves one of the largest
VA catchments. Several other VA facilities in the San Francisco Bay Area
(SFVA, VA Oakland, PAVA) are within driving distance. The P.I and
Co-Investigators have been conducting VA-funded neurobehavioral and MRI
brain imaging studies to study the effects of neurological damage at VA
Martinez. Thus, laboratory space, equipment, trained personnel with
expertise on the study procedures, and patient recruitment protocols in
collaboration with our clinical services are already in place.</div>


<div>
<b>Study design / Overall data collection and analysis plan.</b> The
proposed project will be a cross-sectional observational clinical
science project designed to advance our understanding of brain-behavior
relationships in stroke. <b>1)</b> Advanced MRI neuroimaging
techniques will be used to characterize structural and functional brain
network connectivity in chronic (6 months to 10 years post-injury)
stroke patients, and to correlate whole-brain and network-specific
connectivity metrics with functional and cognitive stroke outcome
measures. Brain network mapping techniques typically require long MRI
acquisitions that might not be suitable for clinical populations. By
using multi-band accelerated MRI protocols released by the NIH Human
Connectome Project, we will be able to acquire high quality data in
clinically feasible acquisition times. <b>2)</b> Brain-behavior
relationships in stroke are typically assessed with voxel (VLSM, VBM) or
region-of-interest (ROI) based mass univariate statistical analyses.
Multi-variate statistical analysis with the Partial Least Squares (PLS)
regression technique will allow us to relate whole-brain connectivity
patterns in stroke patients with their neurocognitive profiles. By using
cross-validation with PLS regression, we will be able to assess the
predictive value of the observed brain-behavior relationships.
<b>3)</b> Another component of this project will involve method
development to facilitate clinical translation. Advanced MRI protocols
to map brain connectivity are often not available or not feasible in
clinical settings. We will develop and test a protocol for estimating
how brain connectivity might be affected by stroke from clinically
available structural brain images. Normative advanced brain imaging data
will be collected from a large group of Veterans without stroke history.
Lesion location and extent will be estimated for individual stroke
patients from commonly available radiological images. Using simulated
lesions applied to control datasets, the likelihood of structural
network disconnection will be estimated for each patient. For
validation, predicted network damage (based on structural imaging alone)
will be compared with actual network connectivity measures based on
advanced MRI data from the same stroke patient. <b>4)</b> We will
distribute the normative brain imaging datasets and the software for
analyzing clinical scans, together with a user’s manual, to VA
clinicians and researchers through the VA VINCI system, so that they can
be applied to clinical imaging repositories in the VA system.</div>


<div>
<b>Study group / Rationale for selection criteria.</b> A total of 120
Veteran participants – 60 stroke survivors, and 60
demographically-matched controls without history of neurological disease
– will participate in MRI brain imaging sessions and neurobehavioral
assessments at VA Martinez. Stroke patients will have suffered a single
cerebro-vascular accident (CVA, ischemic or hemorrhagic) resulting in
unilateral left or right hemispheric or bilateral cerebral lesions
verified by radiological assessments and post-stroke functional
impairments verified from medical records. The patients will be 50-80
years old, 6 months to 10 years post-CVA, and at least 50 years old at
the time of CVA. By 6 moths, spontaneous recovery and functional gains
will have stabilized for the majority of stroke survivors, so that the
neural correlates of persisting deficits can be assessed. Another
consideration for excluding acute patients is that functional
neuroanatomy undergoes continuous change in the initial stages. By the
time we recruit the patients, post-stroke alterations in brain
morphology and tissue composition will have stabilized, so that the
advanced MRI protocols that we have tests on chronic patients can be
applied effectively.</div>


<div>Oftentimes, the goal in stroke research is to isolate the exact neural
correlate of a specific impairment, which requires strict exclusion
criteria. Here, our goal is to study a clinically representative group
with variable lesion location / extent and symptoms, so that whole-brain
connectivity measures can be correlated with overall functional outcome
measures (NIH Stroke Scale and FIM) and residual impairments in global
cognitive functioning (NIH Toolbox fluid cognition and executive
function scores). Therefore, there will be no further restrictions on
stroke patient recruitment, for instance by neurological syndrome, by a
specific deficit in a particular cognitive domain or by presence of
focal damage to a specific brain structure. Further details on subject
selection criteria are listed in the Human Subjects section.</div>


<div>
<b>Subject recruitment.</b> We will use the VANCHCS Computerized
Patient Record System (CPRS) to identify Veteran patients who have
suffered a stroke in the past 5 years. In order to ensure the best
demographic match for the control group, we will focus on Veterans who
are receiving VA care for reasons other than stroke. We have recently
worked with our facility’s Medical Informatics service to verify the
feasibility of conducting automated searches based on ICD codes and
keywords in medical notes. Co-investigators Dr. Chen (VA staff
neurologist), Dr. Baldo (neuropsychologist) and team members Dr. Rose
(VA staff neuropsychologist) and Dr. Loya (neuropsychologist) will
oversee medical record reviews to identify potential research
participants. We will also recruit from the VA Martinez Outpatient
Clinic, the VA Martinez Community Living Center, VA Sacramento Medical
Center and from subject pools from past or ongoing research studies at
our campus. We will send recruitment letters to potentially eligible
participants identified through referrals from clinicians and social
workers, as well as through IRB-approved medical record searches. We
will also post IRB-approved fliers at Vet Centers in the San Francisco
Bay Area (Contra Costa County, Sacramento, Oakland, and San Francisco).</div>


<div>
<b>Study procedures.</b> Research subjects will participate in
multiple sessions at the VANCHCS Martinez campus, all scheduled within 2
to 10 weeks, for a total of 7-10 hours of participation. If a session is
terminated early, e.g. due to subject fatigue or equipment malfunction,
we will schedule new sessions as early as possible. For better subject
retention, we will remain in touch with participants and patient
caregivers to remind them of scheduled sessions, to provide support for
transportation as needed, and send thank you notes after each session.</div>


<div>
<b>Session 1.</b> <b>Informed consent and patient
characterization (up to 2 hours):</b> Semi-structured interviews and
standard self-report questionnaires will screen for exclusionary
criteria (e.g. MRI contraindications, dementing illness) and
characterize general medical history, including the verification of
stroke history obtained from medical records, and the documentation of
rehabilitation history; Assessment of current substance use (Alcohol,
Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test, ASSIST). In order to
facilitate data management and sharing, subject characteristics will be
recorded following the NIH Common Data Elements (CDE) for stroke
[63].</div>


<div>
<b>Session 2. Neurobehavioral assessments – Part 1 (up to 2.5
hours, with breaks as needed)</b> : The modified NIH Stroke Scale (mNIHSS)
[64] and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) [65] to
determine functional outcome in stroke patients. Mini-mental status exam
(MMSE) will screen for cognitive deficits in control subjects. Edinburgh
Handedness Inventory will assess hand dominance (pre-morbid for
hemiparetic patients); Brief versions of Western Aphasia Battery-Revised
(Bedside WAB-R) and Behavioral Inattention Test (BIT) will assess
language and neglect. Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test will provide a
brief assessment of social cognition [66].</div>


<div>
<b>Session 3. MRI brain imaging (60-90 minutes, including
screening, set up and debriefing time).</b> High-resolution structural MRI
(T1w, T2w, FLAIR), multi-shell HARDI diffusion MRI, high temporal
resolution (short TR) resting functional MRI and resting
pseudo-continuous ASL cerebral perfusion imaging. We will use the
multi-band EPI accelerated EPI protocols publicly released by the NIH
Human Connectome Project, so that high quality dMRI and fMRI datasets
can be acquired in clinically feasible times.</div>


<div>
<b>Session 4. Neurobehavioral assessments – Part 2 (up to 2.5
hours, with breaks as needed)</b> : The NIH Toolbox (NIH-TB) will be
administered to all participants for a comprehensive assessment of core
cognitive domains, sensory and motor abilities, as well as emotion
[67, 68].</div>


<div>
<b>Neurobehavioral assessments: administration and scoring.</b> The
modified NIH Stroke Scale (mNIHSS) [64] and the Functional
Independence Measure (FIM) [69-71] will be administered by one of
the licensed clinicians on our team (Dr. Chen, Dr. Baldo, Dr. Rose, Dr.
Loya). NIHSS will provide 11 separate scores on specific abilities
(e.g., speech, attention, motor control). Total NIHSS score will be used
a measure of the severity of residual stroke symptoms (0 = no symptoms
to 42 = maximum severity). FIM will provide a measure of each stroke
patient’s ability to cope with basic life activities on a seven-point
scale (1 = &lt;25% independence, total assistance required; 7 =
100% independence). The NIH Toolbox for the Assessment of Neurological
and Behavioral Function [68] will be administered on a PC in a quiet
room. Executive function, working memory, episodic memory and processing
speed scores from NIH-TB, adjusted for demographic variables including
age, will be used to characterize cognitive, sensory-motor abilities and
emotion with standardized measures. The standardized NIH-TB Fluid
Cognition Composite Score will capture overall cognitive ability. NIH-TB
sensory and motor subscores will be combined to produce a sensori-motor
ability score. Bedside Record Form (BRF) of the Western Aphasia
Battery-Revised (WAB-R) and the Behavioral Inattention Test (BIT) will
screen for language impairments and neglect, respectively. Pre-morbid
ability will be estimated with the Barona Index. While the primary
measures for this project will be NIHSSS, FIM and NIH-TB cognition
scores, the full set of assessments will provide a comprehensive
characterization of the patient group, allowing additional exploratory
analyses for hypothesis generation, and retrospective assessments by
other VA researchers who will have access to our data.</div>


<div>
<b>Retrospective estimation of initial stroke severity.</b> In many
cases, medical records do not include standardized assessments of
acute-stage stroke severity. However, it is possible to estimate the
total NIHSS scores from medical records within two points of actual
scores [72]. Using the scoring system outlined in Kasner et al.
(2003), an acute stage NIHSS score will be estimated by two raters for
each patient. These ratings will be reviewed by VA neurologist Dr. Chen
and VA neuropsychologist Dr. Rose, and the mean rating will be used as
an estimate of initial stroke severity and used as a co-variate in
statistical analyses.</div>


<div>
<b>MRI Brain imaging</b> will be performed at VANCHCS Martinez campus
on a Siemens MAGNETOM Verio 3T scanner equipped with a 32-channel head
coil for parallel imaging. MRI contraindications will be screened upon
enrollment and once again on the day of scanning. Each session will take
~15 min for set up and up to 45 min for scanning. At
least one investigator (Turken, Kang, or Parker), and one specialist
(Curran or a Radiology Service technologist) will be present at each MRI
session. Subject safety will be monitored continuously during scans.
Padding will be used to minimize head movement, which is a source of
artifacts in patient imaging. Gross imaging artifacts (e.g., excessive
head movement, slice drop-outs) will be monitored during acquisition,
and scans will be repeated on the same day or in a second session if
necessary.</div>


<div>
<b>Multi-band accelerated EPI imaging with Human Connectome Project
(HCP) MRI protocols.</b> In order to apply advanced brain mapping
techniques to stroke research in clinically feasible acquisition times,
we will use the multi-band EPI protocols developed and publicly released
by the Washington University-University of Minnesota (WU-Minn)
consortium of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) [35, 36]. The
multi-band protocols sample multiple slices simultaneously, permitting
fast temporal sampling (TR=750 ms per volume) for fMRI studies, and the
coverage of a large number of gradient directions for HARDI diffusion
MRI at high spatial resolution (108 directions at 1.7
mm3 in ~12 min). While the HCP imaging
sequences were developed on a custom-made MRI scanner, public release
include versions adapted for clinical scanners. We have recently
acquired and tested HCP multi-band EPI sequences on our facilities
Siemens Verio clinical MRI scanner. Our data sharing plan includes these
MRI protocols, so that they can be implemented at other VA facilities.</div>


<div>
<b>Structural MRI acquisition and post-processing.</b> For anatomical
reference, high-resolution 3D T1-weighted MP-RAGE images will be
acquired at 1 mm3 isotropic voxel resolution.
T2-weighted and FLAIR images will be acquired with identical resolution.
SPM12 (Welcome Institute for Neurology, London, UK) will be used for
spatial normalization to standard Montreal Neurological Institute MNI152
space with the unified segmentation/ normalization algorithm [73].
Tissue segmentations into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartments will be used for the analysis of
regional tissue loss and whole-brain atrophy. <b>Lesion
delineation:</b> The Automated Lesion Identification (ALI) toolbox will be
used to delineate stoke lesion based on comparison of GM and WM
segmentations from individual patients and the whole control group
[50, 51]. Resulting lesion reconstructions will be verified by
neurologist Dr. Chen and manually edited if necessary.</div>


<div>
<b>Atlas-based parcellation of patient anatomy.</b> The spatial
normalization parameters will be inverted in order to map digital
functional neuroanatomical atlases in MNI space (the Harvard-Oxford
Anatomical atlas [74] and the MGH Yeo-2011 functional connectivity
parcellation atlas [38]) onto each subject’s individual anatomical
image. GM tissue segmentations will be used to further refine these
atlas-derived regions of interest (ROIs) for the analysis of post-stroke
cerebral structural disconnection and altered functional network
organization.</div>


<div>
<b>Multi-shell high-angular-resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI)</b>
data with full cerebral coverage will be acquired using with three
diffusion weightings (b=1000, 2000, 3000 s/mm2). The
HCP WU-Minn multi-band accelerated diffusion protocol will permit us to
combine high angular contrast (108 gradient directions, 39 per shell)
and high spatial resolution with 1.7 mm3 isotropic
voxels in a clinically feasible acquisition time (~14
mins).</div>


<div>
<b>HARDI diffusion MRI post-processing.</b> HARDI images will first be
processed with FSL (FMRIB Software Library, Oxford, UK) to: 1) Correct
for head movements and eddy current-induced distortions with FSL’s EDDY
algorithm; 2) Correct gradient vectors for rotations after movement
correction; 3) Compute standard DTI-derived metrics of white matter
integrity (FA, MD); 4) Correct for EPI geometric distortions with field
map acquisitions; 5) Produce a brain mask, and 5) Co-register the
high-resolution anatomical and diffusion MRI datasets with a linear
transformation. <b>Fiber orientation distribution function
estimation.</b> Using the Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD)
technique [33] implemented in the MRTrix software package [75],
fiber orientation distributions (FOD) will be estimated at each voxel
from post-processed multi-shell HARDI datasets. Application of CSD will
help resolve crossing-fibers (multiple fascicles passing through the
same imaging voxel) in order to achieve the anatomical precision
required for fiber tractography of brain network connections [34, 76,
77].</div>


<div>
<b>High-temporal-resolution multi-band resting-state functional
MRI</b> (R-fMRI) data will be acquired in two 6 minute runs (12 min total).
Subjects will be instructed to relax and stare at a fixation point while
being scanned. T2*-weighted EPI images will be acquired using 34 oblique
slices (interleaved, 20% gap) for whole cerebral coverage with 3.5
mm3 isotropic voxels (210 mm FOV with 60x60 matrix).
Multi-band EPI on a 32-channel head coil will provide a high temporal
resolution with TR = 750 ms [35], permitting better fMRI artifact
reduction and improved sensitivity for detecting BOLD physiological
correlations in the functional connectivity analyses [40].</div>


<div>
<b>Resting fMRI post-processing and artifact reduction.</b> We will
use the AFNI (NIMH, Bethesda, MD) software package to despike the EPI
time series, to correct for head movements, and to mark outlier volumes
with excessive signal change. <b>Physiological artifact removal:</b>
The CompCor procedure [78] will identify five principal components
from white matter and CSF voxel time-series and estimate respiratory and
heart rate artifacts. <b>“Scrubbing” high-motion volumes:</b> EPI
volumes with excessive motion artifacts will be identified with the
frame-wise displacement (FD) measure and removed in order to reduce
spurious correlations [41]. <b>Temporal filtering.</b> A
trigonometric regression filter will be used for temporal filtering
(0.01&lt;<i>f</i> &lt;0.1 Hz bandpass. Using the 3dDeconv
and 3dTproject functions in AFNI, regression filtering and correction
for head movement, respiratory and heart rate artifacts will be carried
out in a single step. <b>EPI distortion correction</b> will be
performed with FSL’s boundary-based registration approach<b>.
Spatial smoothing (4 mm FWHM)</b> will be applied using AFNI’s 3dBlurInMask
function to improve SNR<b>.</b> Artifact-corrected EPI data will be
resampled in the same space as the anatomical images for the analysis of
post-stroke functional network organization.</div>


<div>
<b>Whole-brain fiber tractography.</b> We will use the MRTrix software
package [75] for probabilistic streamline fiber tractography
[34]. The Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD) technique will
resolve crossing-fibers and achieve the anatomical precision required
for cortico-cortical connectivity [33]. The iFOD2 probabilistic
tractography algorithm [32] will generate 5,000,000 fiber
streamlines for each subject, varying in length from 10 to 200 mm, with
a 45° curvature threshold. This procedure will minimize the risk of
missing valid white matter connections. To guard against false positives
in tractography reconstructions, the SIFT (“spherical-deconvolution
informed filtering”) algorithm, implemented in MRTrix v3, will be used
to remove spurious fibers. In brief, this technique assigns weights to
each tractography streamline based on its contribution to predicting the
original diffusion signal, and eliminates poorly fitting or redundant
streamlines from tractography results [79].</div>


<div>
<b>Network construction for inter-regional connectivity analysis.</b>
We will use the Harvard-Oxford (HO) anatomical atlas [74] to define
gray matter regions of interest (ROIs) for connectivity analyses. Based
on expert manual delineations of cerebral anatomy, the Harvard-Oxford
atlas identified major gyral subdivisions of the cortex and subcortical
structures (basal ganglia, thalamus, hippocampus). 112 ROIs will be
defined based on the HO atlas. The Yeo-2011 functional connectivity
atlas [38], based on graph analysis of resting-state fMRI data from
1000 healthy adults, will be used to determine functionally-specialized
resting-state networks including the fronto-parietal executive network
(FPEN), the default mode network (DMN), the dorsal and ventral attention
networks (DAN, VAN), the cingulo-insular salience network (SN), limbic
and sensori-motor networks.</div>


<div>
<b>Regional measures of gray matter integrity.</b> Gray matter tissue
segmentation values will be summed over voxels in each atlas-derived ROI
to quantify regional gray matter loss and regional perfusion in each
patient. Means and standard deviations from the same ROIs in the control
group will be used to standardize ROI-wise gray matter and perfusion
measurements in each patient.</div>


<div>
<b>Structural connectivity.</b> The tck2connectome function from
MRTrix [75] will be used to identify tractography streamline
inter-connecting each pair of atlas-define gray matter ROIs and to
produce structural connectivity matrices where connection strength is
indicated by the number of fiber streamlines between each ROI pair.</div>


<div>
<b>Functional connectivity.</b> Pre-processed resting-fMRI BOLD
time-series will be averaged overall voxels in each ROI. Resting-state
functional connectivity matrices will be computed by correlating the
time-series from each pair of ROIs (Pearson’s <i>r</i> , transformed to
Fisher’s z-scores to ensure normality).</div>


<div>
<b>Structural and functional connectivity networks in the control
group</b> . The Matlab-based Network-based Statistical (NBS) analysis
software [80, 81], which extends the general linear model framework
for voxel-wise MRI analysis to connection-wise whole-network analysis,
will be used to identify which ROI-to-ROI structural and functional
connections can be reliably detected in controls (one-sample t-test,
p&lt;0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons based on 5000
permutations). For better interpretability of findings, patient data
analyses will be restricted to only those network connections that reach
statistical significance for the control group.</div>


<div>
<b>Structural and functional connectivity analysis in the stroke
group</b> . Structural and functional connectivity matrices will be derived
for each patient as described above. The mean and standard deviations
from control group connectivity matrices will be used to compute
<i>z</i> -scores for each ROI-to-ROI connection in each patient’s
connectivity matrix. The resulting standardized structural and
functional connectivity measures will be used to assess neurobehavioral
assessments from stroke patients in relation to the structural
disconnection of cerebral regions and any abnormalities in their
functional connectivity. With this normalization step, brain-behavior
correlation analyses in stroke patients will give more weight to
connections that are robust in the control group, and less weight to
connections that show high inter-subject variability in the
neurologically-healthy brain.</div>


<div>
<b>Graph-theoretic characterization of functional brain network
organization.</b> In addition to connection-wise tests designed to assess
the loss and sparing of which connections are associated with
neurobehavioral outcome measures, we will use graph-theoretic measures
that capture the inter-regional communication and information processing
capacity of large-scale networks [20, 82]. The Matlab-based Brain
Connectivity Toolbox (BCT) [39] will be used to compute the
characteristic path length (CPL) [42], a measure of global
connectivity, communicability [83], a measure of the ease with which
information can flow in a network, and modularity [15], a measure of
the functional segregation of subnetworks. These network-based measures
have been used in previous studies to characterize post-stroke
alterations in brain connectivity [31, 46, 48, 84]. In this project,
we will employ graph-theoretic measures to characterize how well the
spared brain regions are functionally integrated and how well they
communicate with each other in each stroke patient, and as assess how
well functional connectivity measures predict neurobehavioral
impairments in chronic stroke.</div>
