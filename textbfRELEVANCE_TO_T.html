<div><b>RELEVANCE TO THE VA HEALTH CARE MISSION</b></div>


<div>Over 15,000 Veterans receive VA care for stroke each year (VA HSR&amp;D
Stroke QUERI Fact Sheet, 2014). With the aging Vietnam War Veteran
population, stroke will likely remain a major VA concern. While stroke
mortality has declined owing to improved acute treatment [1], 40%
of stroke survivors experience long-term disability [2]. Currently,
the ability to predict outcome for individual patients remains limited
[3]. Patients with apparently similar brain lesions can have
variable outcomes. We propose a clinical neuroscience project to assess
how the variability in functional and cognitive stroke outcome relates
to stroke-induced brain connectivity alterations. The current generation
of radiological assessments do not provide information on how stroke has
affected brain connectivity, do that such information is not available
to clinicians and neurorehabilitation experts. Better understanding of
post-stroke cerebral connectivity alterations can inform patient
prognosis and patient care decisions [55]. For instance, knowledge
of which cerebral have been spared can indicate recovery potential
through network re-organization. Early intense therapy and interventions
using targeted non-invasive brain modulation [56] can aim to promote
recovery through neuroplastic functional network re-organization
[22]. Conversely, the knowledge that individual brain regions have
become severely disconnection from each other might indicate that
recovery potential is limited, so that efforts can focus on teaching
compensatory skills and the use of assistive technologies.
