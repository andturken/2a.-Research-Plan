<div>In
a follow up analysis, we correlated the lesion load in major
intra-hemispheric fiber pathways with WAB performance. For this purpose,
we expressed the overlap between each patientâ€™s binary lesion mask and
each atlas-defined fiber tract of interest (e.g., arcuate fasciculus,
uncinate, inferior occipito-frontal fasciculus, middle longitudinal
fascicle) as a percentage of total tract volume (see below, left, for
example cases). The interesting finding was that damage to each tract
was associated with impairments in more than one domain, and each
language domain was associated with more than one fiber tract (Figure
4). Our interpretation was that the most severe aphasic impairments in
the chronic stage are caused by lesions that impact overall connectivity
of the left hemisphere, so that the ability of spared brain regions to
re-route information is highly reduced, limiting post-stroke recovery.</div>
